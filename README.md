**Job Description Generator**\n
The Job Description Generator is a web application that automates the creation of job descriptions based on user input. It leverages Flask (Python) for the backend, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and integrates with Gemma 2B, a powerful language model, to generate structured and high-quality job descriptions.

**Features**
âœ… User-Friendly Interface â€“ Simple web-based form to input job title, skills, responsibilities, and qualifications.\n
âœ… AI-Powered Generation â€“ Uses Gemma 2B to generate job descriptions dynamically.\n
âœ… Customization Options â€“ Users can edit and refine the generated descriptions.\n
âœ… API Integration â€“ Fetches industry-specific keywords and role-based suggestions via external APIs.\n
âœ… Export & Share â€“ Download job descriptions as PDF or copy text for easy sharing.
âœ… Flask Backend â€“ Handles requests and integrates with the AI model for real-time text generation.

**Tech Stack**
   Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla JS or a lightweight framework)
   Backend: Flask (Python)
   AI Model: Gemma 2B (Google's Open-Weight LLM)
   API Usage: External APIs for job roles, industry-specific terms, and skills suggestions
   Deployment: Flask app hosted on vercel
**How It Works**
  User enters job details (title, responsibilities, qualifications, etc.).
  The app sends this data to the Flask backend.
  Flask processes the request and uses Gemma 2B to generate a detailed job description.
  The generated job description is displayed in the UI with editing options.
  Users can download or copy the final description.
**Future Enhancements**
  ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Integration
  More AI Models Support (Llama, GPT, etc.)
  Job Board Posting Feature
  Multilingual Support
This project is ideal for HR professionals and recruiters looking to streamline job description creation. ðŸš€
